# graphic pipeline
- vertex processing / geometry stage / vertex shader
  - processes all vertices independently in the same way
  - performs transformations per vertex, computes lighting per vertex
- geometry shader
  - generates, modifies, discards primitives
- primitive assembly and rasterization / rasterization stage
  - assembles primitives such as points, lines, triangles
  - converts primitives into a raster image
  - generates fragments / pixel candidates
  - fragment attributes are interpolated from vertices of a primitive
- fragment processing / fragment shader
  - processes all fragments independently in the same way
  - fragments are processed, discarded or stored in the framebuffer
